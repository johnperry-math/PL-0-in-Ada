# PL-0-in-Ada
An implementation of the PL/0 compiler in the Ada language

I sat in a compiler construction class where we worked on versions of a compiler for the PL/0 language using C, C++, Java, Pascal, Python, C#, PHP, Bash, and perhaps some others that slip my mind. As a project/alternative to the final, we could add features for concurrency using the keywords COBEGIN and COEND, where each statement between those two executes in a separate thread. That was fun to do in C++. In any case, it was interesting to see this compiler written in all sorts of languages.

But not Ada.

I decided to rectify that. I learned a little Ada and managed to get it working without too much trouble. The hardest part was figuring out Ada's concurrency features. All in all, though, it was a lot of fun, and I find Ada to be a beautiful language. I hope I can work more with it in the future.
